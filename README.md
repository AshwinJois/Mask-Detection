# Mask-Detection-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV
The CNN tells us if a person is wearing  a mask or not!


Hello, 
We all know how Deep learning is dominating in the field of Computer Vision!! It is a technique that teaches network to do a specific task. The reason behind so many innovations in these days are because of Deep Learning. Some examples are  driverless cars, voice control on our phones, tablets and TVs. Deep Learning is getting lots of attention and is achieving many tasks which could not be achieved before. 
Here, I have explained how to detect a Person with and without mask in an image using a Convolutional Neural Network. To make the detections even more attractive I have also used bounding boxes. 

Understanding Convolutional Neural Network

A CNN is a Neural Network used to extract some features of the Image. The CNN is capable of differentiating the images given to it and figure out the unique features in them. CNN takes the Imageâ€™s raw pixel data, trains the model and then extracts the features for classification.

When we look at a picture of an Elephant, we can classify it by looking at the identifiable features such as ears, face , trunk, tusks or 4 legs. In a similar way, the computer is able perform image classification by looking for low level features such as edges and curves, and then building up to more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers. This is a general overview of what a CNN does. 



Architecture of a CNN

A CNN is composed of several kinds of layers: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, Fully connected input layer, Fully connected layer, Fully Connected output layer.
